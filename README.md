# Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on performing sentiment analysis. It classifies text into various sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral, based on the provided dataset. The implementation demonstrates the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## Usage

1.Prepare Your Dataset:  
  Place your dataset in the data/ directory.  
  Update the script to point to your dataset file.  
2.Customize Preprocessing:  
  Modify preprocessing steps (e.g., stemming, lemmatization) in the scripts/preprocessing.py file.  
3.Train and Evaluate Models:  
  Train the model using your data by running main.py.  
4.View Results:  
  The output will include metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.
