# sentiment_analysis
In this project we used stemming process to convert all words in the tweets to there base word and then applied logistic regression and random forest regressior . Then we compared both the models and since the logistic regression is more suitable for this .
Then using tinkter and matplotlib created an interface that takes a word from user and check the negative and positive tweets realted to thw word entered and makes the pie chart.
